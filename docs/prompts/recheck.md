 now we‚Äôre talking about true backend integration, not just a shared front-end.
That means your unified platform needs three key layers working together:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Unified Auth & Access Control
Keycloak remains the single source of truth for identity & permissions.

All services use the same Keycloak realm & roles.

Example:

Role data_engineer ‚Üí can create Airbyte connections, run Prefect jobs, push to MinIO.

Role ml_engineer ‚Üí can train models in MLflow, pull datasets from MinIO.

Tokens from Keycloak are passed between services (OIDC JWTs), so:

Airbyte ‚Üí sends signed URL to MinIO using the same user identity

MLflow ‚Üí can fetch datasets from MinIO respecting permissions

2Ô∏è‚É£ Shared Metadata & Registry Layer
OpenMetadata becomes the ‚Äúglue‚Äù for dataset, pipeline, model, and job information.

All services register their artifacts here:

Airbyte ‚Üí ‚ÄúCreated dataset: sales_data_v2‚Äù (links to MinIO storage)

Prefect ‚Üí ‚ÄúRan job: daily_sales_sync‚Äù (linked to Airbyte connection)

MLflow ‚Üí ‚ÄúModel trained on: sales_data_v2‚Äù (linked to dataset in OpenMetadata)

Portal UI queries OpenMetadata API ‚Üí shows relationships, search results, lineage.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Unified Storage & Data Access
MinIO is your single object storage.

Every tool writes & reads from it using the same S3-compatible bucket paths:

Airbyte ‚Üí writes raw/processed data to s3://raw_data/ or s3://processed/

Great Expectations ‚Üí stores validation reports in s3://quality_reports/

MLflow ‚Üí stores models in s3://ml_models/

DuckDB & PostgreSQL can read from MinIO directly (via S3 API).

This means if Airbyte ingests ‚Üí MinIO ‚Üí Prefect pipeline ‚Üí MLflow training ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí all happen without moving data between silos.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Orchestration Layer
Use Prefect or Kestra to manage multi-service workflows:

Example Workflow:

markdown
Copy
Edit
1. Trigger Airbyte sync
2. Validate with Great Expectations
3. Store in MinIO
4. Trigger MLflow training job
5. Update OpenMetadata lineage
6. Send alert in Slack
Orchestration runs inside Kubernetes/Docker, calling each service API.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Unified Portal (React + Backend API Gateway)
Frontend (React):

Single login with Keycloak

Shows dashboards from multiple services

Provides ‚ÄúCreate Dataset‚Äù button ‚Üí triggers Airbyte ingestion ‚Üí stores in MinIO ‚Üí registers in OpenMetadata

Backend API Gateway (FastAPI/Node):

Talks to Airbyte, MinIO, Prefect, MLflow, OpenMetadata APIs with the same user context (via Keycloak tokens)

Ensures security & metadata updates automatically

Your Stack for True Integration
Layer	Tool
Auth & RBAC	Keycloak
Metadata & Search	OpenMetadata
Storage	MinIO (S3 API)
Ingestion	Airbyte
Orchestration	Prefect or Kestra
Data Quality	Great Expectations
Analytics	DuckDB, Postgres
ML	MLflow
Monitoring	Grafana, Prometheus
Cost Tracking	Komiser
Unified UI	React portal + Backend API gateway

üí° Result:
When you create a dataset in Airbyte:

Stored in MinIO.

Metadata pushed to OpenMetadata.

Accessible by MLflow, DuckDB, Great Expectations without any config changes.

Visible in unified UI with lineage, permissions, and actions.

If you want, I can draft the integration blueprint + portal skeleton where:

Keycloak handles SSO

MinIO is common storage

OpenMetadata is the central registry

API Gateway routes all service requests with unified auth

React UI shows both embedded existing UIs and integrated dashboards

That blueprint will basically define how  SaaS behaves as one product instead of glued tools.

Do you want me to prepare that full integration plan next? That‚Äôs the key step before coding.




since all services are already running in Docker,  UI project will not rebuild their UIs but will:

Embed existing UIs (Airbyte, OpenMetadata, MLflow, etc.) inside a single React shell

Provide cross-service actions (e.g., trigger Airbyte job ‚Üí store in MinIO ‚Üí register in OpenMetadata)

Handle shared login (Keycloak SSO) & pass tokens to each service

Show custom dashboards that combine metadata from multiple APIs

1Ô∏è‚É£ Architecture
java
Copy
Edit
React 18 + Vite + TypeScript (Frontend)
        |
API Gateway (FastAPI / Node.js) ‚Äî talks to:
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Airbyte API
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Prefect API
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MLflow API
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpenMetadata API
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MinIO API
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Keycloak Auth (OIDC)
API Gateway injects the same Keycloak JWT into all service calls

Frontend uses the gateway, never directly talks to service APIs

Service UIs are embedded in iframes or microfrontend wrappers

2Ô∏è‚É£ Example React Page Structure
Dashboard ‚Üí Shows stats from multiple tools (datasets, models, running jobs)

Data Ingestion ‚Üí Airbyte embedded UI + custom "Quick Create Pipeline" form

Metadata Explorer ‚Üí OpenMetadata UI embedded + lineage graph

ML Experiments ‚Üí MLflow UI embedded + quick model deploy button

Monitoring ‚Üí Grafana dashboards

Admin ‚Üí Keycloak admin panel (embedded, restricted to admins)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Embedding Existing Service UIs
You can mount Airbyte, MLflow, etc., on different subpaths in your Nginx/K8s ingress and then embed:

tsx
Copy
Edit
<iframe
  src="/airbyte"  // reverse proxy to Airbyte container
  style={{ width: '100%', height: '100vh', border: 'none' }}
/>
This keeps their full UI but under your SSO & navigation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Assisted UI Build Process
You can use v0.dev (Vercel), Bolt.new, or Locofy.ai to speed up React UI generation from prompts.
Here‚Äôs a starter AI prompt for your unified portal UI:

Prompt for AI UI Builder:

sql
Copy
Edit
You are building a React 18 + Vite + TypeScript dashboard for a Unified Data Orchestration Platform.

Requirements:
- Single-page layout with top navigation bar (Dashboard, Data Ingestion, Metadata, ML Experiments, Monitoring, Admin)
- Left sidebar for quick actions
- All pages use Keycloak SSO for login, with user roles from JWT
- Embed existing services via iframes:
  - Airbyte at /airbyte
  - OpenMetadata at /metadata
  - MLflow at /mlflow
  - Grafana at /grafana
- Dashboard page shows:
  - Number of datasets (from OpenMetadata API)
  - Number of running pipelines (from Prefect API)
  - Number of trained models (from MLflow API)
  - Cost savings (from Komiser API)
- All API calls go through a backend gateway at /api/*
- Styling: TailwindCSS, responsive design
- State management: React Query for API data
- Include a role-based access control check in each page
Output: A complete React + Vite project with routing, pages, and placeholder API calls.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Integration with Backend Gateway
The backend gateway will:

Take your Keycloak JWT from frontend

Call Airbyte, OpenMetadata, MinIO, Prefect, MLflow with the same user identity

Merge results when needed (e.g., dataset list with pipeline info)

Return JSON to frontend

Example endpoint in FastAPI:

python
Copy
Edit
@app.get("/datasets")
async def get_datasets(user: User = Depends(auth)):
    datasets = openmetadata_client.list_datasets(user)
    for ds in datasets:
        ds["pipelines"] = prefect_client.get_pipelines_for_dataset(ds["id"], user)
    return datasets
6Ô∏è‚É£ Suggested Workflow
Pick AI UI generator (v0.dev is fastest for dashboard scaffolding)

Generate base React project with above prompt

Add Keycloak OIDC login flow

Implement backend API Gateway with unified token handling

Embed service UIs & test token forwarding

Style navigation for clean unified look

If you want, I can now give you:

Backend Gateway scaffold (FastAPI with Keycloak auth + service connectors)

React Portal scaffold (already wired for SSO & embedded UIs)
So you can just plug in URLs of your running Docker services and get a working unified portal in a day.

Do you want me to prepare both scaffolds together so they match perfectly? That way, integration is plug-and-play.
